#Polya Urn


The following lines of code samples observations from a Dirichlet process with a  base measure in argument, which is also interpreted as the color distribution in the Polya urn scheme.

```{r}
polya_urn_model <- function(base_measure, N_ball, alpha) {
  balls <- c()
  for (i in 1:N_ball) {
    if (runif(1) < alpha / (alpha + length(balls))) {
      # Add a new ball color.
      new_color <- base_measure()
      balls <- c(balls, new_color)
    } else {
      # Pick out a ball from the urn, and add back a
      # ball of the same color.
      ball <- balls[sample(1:length(balls), 1)]
      balls <- c(balls, ball)
    }
  }
  balls
}
```


This is applied to sample 10 observations from a Dirichlet process with a  Gaussian $N(0,1)$ base measure, which is also interpreted as the color distribution in the P\'oly urn scheme, and precision parameter varying from 1, 10 to 100.

```{r}
N_ball <- 10
# with alpha = 1
polya_sample <- polya_urn_model(function() rnorm(1), N_ball, 1)
rev(sort(table(polya_sample)))
# with alpha = 10
polya_sample <- polya_urn_model(function() rnorm(1), N_ball, 10)
rev(sort(table(polya_sample)))
# with alpha = 100
polya_sample <- polya_urn_model(function() rnorm(1), N_ball, 100)
rev(sort(table(polya_sample)))
```


# Stick-breaking representation

As we know, the Dirichlet process is a discrete random probability measure which can be represented as a convex combination of infinitely many Dirac masses, 
\begin{equation*}
		G = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \pi_k\delta_{\phi_k}.
\end{equation*}
The stick-breaking representation,  due to \cite{sethuraman1994constructive}, provides a constructive way of building the weights $(\pi_k)_k$ of the Dirichlet process. This is done by sequentially breaking a stick of initial unit length, into pieces whose lengths correspond to the $(\pi_k)_k$. More specifically, we require independent and identically distributed (iid) random variables $V_k\sim Beta(1,\alpha)$. The first weight $\pi_1$ corresponds to $V_1$. This leaves a piece of length $1-V_1$, which is broken at $V_2$ in order to define $\pi_2=V_2(1-V_1)$. And sequentially, the same procedure is applied to the remaining part, which equals $(1-V_1)(1-V_2)$ at this second step. It is easy to see that after $k$ steps, one defines $\pi_k=V_k(1-V_1)\cdots(1-V_{k-1})$, and the remaining piece has length $(1-V_1)\cdots(1-V_{k})$. The representation is completed by assuming iid draws from the base measure $G_0$ for the locations $\phi_k$, independent from the $V_k$.

\begin{theorem}[\citep{sethuraman1994constructive}]
	Let $V_1,V_2,\ldots\sim iid Beta(1,\alpha)$ and $\phi_1,\phi_2,\ldots\simiid G_0$ be independent random variables. Define
	\begin{align*}
		\pi_1 &= V_1,\\
		\pi_k &= V_k(1-V_1)\cdots(1-V_{k-1}), \text{ for any } k\geq 2.
	\end{align*}
	Then $G = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \pi_k\delta_{\phi_k} \sim \DP(\alpha G_0)$.
\end{theorem}

The proof of this result is in two steps. First, to show that the remaining stick length at step $k$, $(1-V_1)\cdots(1-V_{k})$, converges to zero as $k\to\infty$. This ensures that the weights vector lives in the unit simplex, and in turn that the measure $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \pi_k\delta_{\phi_k}$ is a probability measure. Second, to use the stick-breaking construction to show that the defined $G$ satisfies the distributional equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:DP_dist_equation}
	G = V\delta_\phi + (1-V)G,
\end{equation}
where $V\sim Beta(1,\alpha)$ and $\phi\sim G$, independently. Finally, one can show that the Dirichlet process is the only solution to equation~\ref{eq:DP_dist_equation} by properties of the Dirichlet distribution, together with Definition~\ref{def:DP_marginal}.

```{r}
stick_breaking_process = function(num_weights, alpha) {
  betas = rbeta(num_weights, 1, alpha)
  remaining_stick_lengths = c(1, cumprod(1 - betas))[1:num_weights]
  weights = remaining_stick_lengths * betas
  weights
}
```


```{r}
num_weights <- 50
draw_stick_breaking <- function(alpha) {
  labels <- 1:num_weights
  locations <- rnorm(num_weights)
  SB_weights <- stick_breaking_process(num_weights, alpha)
  df <- data.frame(labels, locations, SB_weights)
  order_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(labels, SB_weights, fill = as.factor(labels))) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
    theme(legend.position="none") 
  location_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(locations, SB_weights, fill = as.factor(labels))) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = .1) + 
    theme(legend.position="none") 
  grid.arrange(order_plot, location_plot, ncol = 2)
}
